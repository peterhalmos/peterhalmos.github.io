  <h1>Peter Halmos</h1>
<p> 

Hi! I’m a CS PhD student at Princeton University and am fortunate to be advised by <a href = “https://raphael-group.github.io/”> Ben Raphael </a>. I previously graduated from Columbia University as a Computer Science major with a concentration in Chemistry. At Columbia and the New York Genome Center I was fortunate to have met and worked with <a href = "https://davidaknowles.github.io/">David Knowles</a> who introduced me to the intersection of machine learning and computational biology.

    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <ul>
My research lies at the intersection of pure machine learning and computational biology. I am interested in the computational and mathematical aspects of optimal transport, including low-rank and neural optimal transport, as well as flow-based generative models. My focus is on developing and adapting these tools to quantitatively infer developmental trajectories in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, and to understand the dynamics of cell differentiation in space and time.

<h2>Previous Research Projects</h2>
<ul>
   <li>I also worked at <a href="https://www.foundationmedicine.com">Foundation Medicine</a> as an undergraduate, supervised by Justin Newberg, Garrett Frampton, and Megan Montesion. I worked on two projects accepted to AACR 2020 as abstracts
   <ul>
     <li> <i>Pan-chromosome analysis does not reveal parental or ancestral bias in chromosome loss of heterozygosity</i> and <i>Pan-cancer analysis of sex differences and their associations with ancestry and genomic biomarkers in a large comprehensive genomic profiling dataset </i>
   </ul>

</ul>

<h2>Teaching</h2>
<p>
I was previously a teaching assistant for Organic Chemistry at Columbia with Professor Talha Siddiqui. During the summers of 2023, I was a Computer Science instructor at the King Summer Institute, where I taught an introductory Java course. I taught 3 hours/weekday for the duration of the course, wrote daily problem sets, held instructor office hours, and meet with students one on one to address questions they had about the material. 

<h2>Other</h2>
Outside of my academic interests I am an avid hiker and an amateur birder, botanist, and <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/143173976@N05/">photographer</a>. Credits for this website template go to <a href="https://eg314159.github.io">Elena Gribelyuk</a>, who I shamelessly lifted this from.
