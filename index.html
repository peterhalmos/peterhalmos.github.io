  <h1>Elena Gribelyuk</h1>
<p> 

Hi! I'm a third-year CS PhD student at Princeton University, where I'm fortunate to be advised by <a href = https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~hy2/> Huacheng Yu </a>. In 2022, I graduated from Columbia University, where I double-majored in mathematics (with honors) and computer science. I'm very lucky to have been advised by <a href = "https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~andoni/">Alexandr Andoni</a>, who introduced me to sketching/streaming and inspired me to pursue TCS, and <a href = "https://www.math.columbia.edu/~khovanov/" >Mikhail Khovanov</a>, who generously shared his love for mathematics with me and provided endless support throughout my work with him.

    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
    <ul>
I'm primarily interested in streaming and sketching algorithms, communication complexity, and graph algorithms, although I'm broadly interested in theoretical computer science. Most recently, I've been thinking about adversarial robustness in the streaming model.

<h2>Teaching</h2>
<p>
During the summers of 2020-2022, I was a mathematics instructor at the King Summer Institute, where I taught the six-week accelerated Pre-Calculus course to 10-15 students. My responsibilities included teaching for 3 hours/weekday, writing all course materials, holding instructor office hours, and meeting with students individually to check in and offer additional help when needed. 

Also, I have been a teaching assistant for the following courses at Princeton and Columbia University. My responsibilities included grading homework and exams, holding office hours and recitations, writing practice problems, and editing lecture notes.
</p>
<ul>
<li> COS 423 Theory of Algorithms, taught by Professor Robert Tarjan in Spring 2024</li>
<li> COS 521 Advanced Algorithm Design, taught by Professor Huacheng Yu in Fall 2023</li>
  <li>COMS 4995 Advanced Algorithms, taught by Professor Alexandr Andoni in Spring 2022</li>
  <li>CSOR W4231 Analysis of Algorithms, taught by Professor Alexandr Andoni in Fall 2021</li>
  <li>MATH UN2030 Ordinary Differential Equations, taught by Professor Evgeni Dimitrov in Fall 2021</li>
  <li>CSOR W4231 Analysis of Algorithms, taught by Professor Xi Chen in Summer 2021</li>
  <li>COMS W3261 Computer Science Theory, taught by Timothy Randolph in Summer 2021</li>
  <li>MATH GU4042 Modern Algebra II, taught by Professor Inbar Klang in Spring 2021</li>
  <li>COMS W3203 Discrete Math: Combinatorics and Graph Theory, taught by Professor Ansaf Salleb-Aouissi in Fall 2020 and Spring 2021</li>
</ul>
Lastly, I gave lectures and served as a TA for the Columbia Undergraduate Math Society's Introduction to Proofs workshop in 
<a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~ums/introproofs2020.html">Fall 2020</a> and <a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~ums/IntroToProofsFall2021.html">Fall 2021</a>.
This was a 4-week workshop series for undergraduate students that teaches how to write mathematical proofs.

<h2>Other</h2>
Outside of TCS/math, I love classical music and playing the piano (my favorite composer is Rachmaninoff :)). I'm also passionate about math education, and I am a part-time mathematics instructor at <a href ="https://princeton.aopsacademy.org/?_gl=1*1cmmme3*_ga*MzYwODQzMTQwLjE2ODg2OTA3OTE.*_ga_NVWC1BELMR*MTY4ODY5MDc5MS4xLjAuMTY4ODY5MDc5My41OC4wLjA."> Art of Problem Solving</a> (Princeton location) in my free time.
